# Components

## Naming

my-component-file.tsx

## Main Idea

If we need to share this component to another common library repository for reusing it on a third one, should be as simple as copy and paste the folder.

## Structure

This folder should contain the react components used on the application.

Every component is encapsulated by a folder, witch includes all necessary code:

-   my-component.scss
-   my-component.tsx
-   my-component.stories.tsx
-   my-component.test.tsx

If the component has unique assets like logos, icons. Should be included as well.
